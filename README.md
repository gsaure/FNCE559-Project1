# FNCE559-Project1

For this project, we were given a database that includes a list of blockchains, blocks, transactions, and log events. Here, we extracted information regarding chain popularity, the ethernet network, and miner costs.

This code was run on a supercomputer with a large DeFi database bought by our professor, to which the data was exported to a CSV for data analysis on PowerBI.

This was made in **Julia!** ðŸ’²
